# BeerPhoria

The purpose of this application is to create a beer logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars, Sequelize and a homemade ORM. This project will follow the MVC design pattern by using Node and MySQL to query and route data in the application, and Handlebars to generate the HTML.


# Project Description
To create an application that can be used to track beef selections and prefences that can be ordered and remembered for future visits. Application will connect remotely to a Heroku database and will feature Node, Express, MySQL, Sequelize and Handlebars.

# Summary

* In this project we created an application that will allow users to dynamically interact with a beer selection program. Users will "select" options based on taste prefences and based on the results, a beer will be presented to reflect the user's selections. Application will include a "tab" style component that allows the user to retain a history of previous selections. As a bonus if time permits, application could feature a recommendation option for users who are unsure of what beers they prefer.
