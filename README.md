# BeerPhoria

The purpose of this application is to create a beer logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars, and Sequelize. This project will follow the MVC design pattern by using Node and MySQL to query and route data in the application, and Handlebars to generate the HTML.


# Project Description
To create an application that can be used to track beer selections and prefences that can be  viewed and remembered for future visits. Application will connect remotely to a Heroku database and will feature Node, Express, MySQL, Sequelize and Handlebars.

# Summary

* In this project we created an application that will allow users to dynamically interact with a beer selection program. Users will "select" a beer "type beer name" and based on taste prefences view the results. A beer will be presented to reflect the user's selections. Future development for the application will include a "tab" style component that allows the user to retain a history of previous selections. As a bonus if time permits, application could feature a recommendation option for users who are unsure of what beers they prefer.
